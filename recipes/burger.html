            <dd>Ground chuck is a great all-purpose, 
                buy-it-anywhere choice for burgers. 
                But if you want to get ambitious and blend, 
                say, chuck with ground short rib or brisket, 
                we say go for it.</dd>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for pan)</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck (20% fat)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li>4 potato rolls, toasted</li>
            <li>Ketchup, mayonnaise, shredded iceberg lettuce, and dill pickle slices (for serving)</li>
        </ul>    

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Heat a cast-iron griddle or large heavy skillet over medium-high until very hot, about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with vegetable oil. 
                Divide ground beef into 4 equal portions (do not form patties).</li>
                <li>Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat with a spatula to form 4"-diameter patties 
                craggy edges are your friend). Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown, about 2 minutes.</li> 
                Flip patties, season with salt, and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese droops and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles.</li>
        </ol>
